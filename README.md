Normalizing Apple-specific CgBI-fried PNG files. From <http://www.jongware.com/pngdefry.html>

Some more details on CgBI can be found here: <http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/CgBI_file_format>

Note that this repo is created as an archive.

Compiling
----------

This code does not depend on any external libraries, so compiling is as easy as this:

    $ cc pngdefry.c -o pngdefry

Note that you need to compile only **pngdefry.c**, because it includes **miniz.c**.
